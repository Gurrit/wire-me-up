# `app` module

This is the workspace for the exercise. The framework and the database
are wired up — you're filling in controllers, services and persistence.

See the top-level [`README.md`](../README.md) for the exercise spec.

```

Note: `auth/AuthenticatedUser.java` lives under `src/main/scala/` alongside
the Scala sources — it stays as a Java `@interface` because Spring's
`hasParameterAnnotation` requires a proper Java annotation type.

## The `@AuthenticatedUser` argument resolver

Spring MVC lets you write controller methods like this:

```scala
@PostMapping(Array("/emails"))
def send(@AuthenticatedUser caller: UserDetails,
         @RequestBody body: SendEmailRequest): ResponseEntity[_] = { ... }
```

…and have the framework figure out where the `UserDetails` value comes
from.

### What's already wired

- `@AuthenticatedUser` — a marker annotation you stick on controller
  parameters.
- `AuthenticatedUserArgumentResolver`: mostly implemented, what you need to implement is the `resolveUserDetails` method.
- throwing `ResponseStatusException` with a status will be propagated to the HTTP response

The two failing tests in `AuthIntegrationTest` are your acceptance
check — once `resolveUserDetails` is right, both should go green.

### Not your style?

The argument-resolver setup is there to remove a choice you'd otherwise
spend time on — but you don't have to use it. If you'd rather do something else, go ahead!

## Tests

There are two test source roots, each with a different purpose and runtime
cost.

### Unit tests — `src/test/scala`

- Run during `mvn test`.
- Should be fast and should **NOT** boot a Spring context, use plain
  JUnit 5 and optionally mocks to test a single class in isolation.
- `spring-boot-starter-test` already brings JUnit 5, AssertJ and Mockito
  for you.
- `ExampleUnitTest.scala` is a one-line placeholder so the directory isn't
  empty. Delete it once you have real unit tests.

### Integration tests — `src/integrationTest/scala`

- Run during `mvn verify` (so they're skipped during `mvn test`).
- Extend `AbstractIntegrationTest` to get the full Spring context on a
  random port, a preconfigured `TestRestTemplate`, a `JdbcTemplate`, a
  per-test `emails`-table reset, and constants for the pre-baked
  tokens / user ids.
- `AuthIntegrationTest` next to it ships two **failing** examples
  (missing-token → 401, expired-token → 401). They're failing on
  purpose — they're the acceptance check for the auth resolver
  you're going to implement. They go green once
  `AuthenticatedUserArgumentResolver.resolveUserDetails` is done.

### Commands

```bash
./mvnw -pl app -am test     # unit tests only (fast)
```
```bash
./mvnw -pl app -am verify   # unit tests + integration tests
```
